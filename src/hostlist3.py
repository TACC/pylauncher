"""Handle hostlist expressions.

This module provides operations to expand and collect hostlist
expressions.

The hostlist expression syntax is the same as in several programs
developed at LLNL (https://computing.llnl.gov/linux/). However in
corner cases the behaviour of this module have not been compared for
compatibility with pdsh/dshbak/SLURM et al.
